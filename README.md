## Task-2: Grade Calculator (Dynamic Web Project)

The Grade Calculator is a Dynamic Web Project. It allows you to calculate grades based on input scores. To set up and run the project:

1. Navigate to the 'Task-2/GradeCalculator' directory.
2. Import the project into your preferred Java EE IDE (like Eclipse).
3. Configure a local servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat) to run the project.
4. Build and deploy the project to the servlet container.
5. Access the project's web application via a web browser at `http://localhost:port/GradeCalculator/index.jsp` after starting a local server.

Alternatively, you can run the project by right-clicking on the `index.jsp` file in your IDE and selecting "Run on Server."

## Task-3: ATM Machine (Maven Project)

The ATM Machine project is a Maven-based Java project that simulates an ATM. To set up and run the project:

1. Navigate to the 'Task-3/Atm-Machine' directory.
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.
3. Build and run the project.
4. Access the project's web application via a web browser at `http://localhost:port/Atm-Machine/index.jsp` after starting a local server.

Alternatively, you can run the project by right-clicking on the `index.jsp` file in your IDE and selecting "Run on Server."

## Task-5: Student Management System (Maven Project)

The Student Management System is another Maven-based Java project that manages student records. To set up and run the project:

1. Navigate to the 'Task-5/student-management-system' directory.
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.
3. Build and run the project.
4. Access the project's web application via a web browser at `http://localhost:port/student-management-system/index.jsp` after starting a local server.

Alternatively, you can run the project by right-clicking on the `index.jsp` file in your IDE and selecting "Run on Server."

Please note that you need to have the necessary Java and server environment set up to run these projects. Refer to the respective project's README or documentation for more detailed instructions.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance.
